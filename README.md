# LightSensor
This is an NXT Light Sensor block for the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 programming environment. Sensor, loop, switch, and wait block modes are supported as is the port view panel. It currently does not support calibration or using the block with an EV3 brick. Only the NXT brick is currently supported. Very little testing has been done.

To install, copy the entire LightSensor folder to the Resources\Blocks folder and restart the EV3 software.

Please be aware that using this block may be against the rules of FIRST LEGO League. If you plan on using this block in an FLL competition, contact FIRST or your local FLL Operational Partner beforehand.

If you would like to help work on improving this block, you can download the [EV3 Block Developer Kit from LEGO](https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/developer-kits).
